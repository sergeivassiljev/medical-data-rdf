Your task is to convert a provided medical text into the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. RDF represents data as triples in the form of <subject> <predicate> <object>. To accomplish this, follow these simplified steps:

Input Medical Text:
{medical_text}

Instructions:

Extract RDF Triples:

Identify key information within the text that can be represented as RDF triples.
For each piece of information, determine the subject, predicate, and object.
Format these as <subject> <predicate> <object>.
Organize RDF Triples:

Once all triples are identified and formatted, count the total number of triples.
Divide this total by N to determine how many triples should ideally be in each part. If you cannot divide them evenly, some parts will have one more triple than others.
Organize the triples into N parts accordingly.
Output Format:

Provide the total number of RDF triples identified.
For each part (up to N parts), list the RDF triples it contains. Format your response as follows:

Copy code
Total RDF Triples: [Total Number]

Part 1:
- <subject> <predicate> <object>
- <subject> <predicate> <object>
[...]

Part N:
- <subject> <predicate> <object>
- <subject> <predicate> <object>
[...]
Ensure that the triples are evenly distributed across the parts, following the instructions above.

Example:

Part 1:
- <Patient> <hasCondition> <object>
- <Patient> <hasCondition> <object>

Part 2:
- <Patient> <hasTest> <object>
- <Patient> <hasTest> <object>

Part 3:
- <Patient> <hasTestResult> <object>
- <Patient> <hasTestResult> <object>
